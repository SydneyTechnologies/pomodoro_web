      <p className="text-lg">
        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
        Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break
        down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated
        by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in
        English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped
        kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites
        providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as
        timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software
        design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.
